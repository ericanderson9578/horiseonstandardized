# <horiseonstandardized>

## Description
I improved the horiseon website so that it would fit modern html5 standards be more accessible and future proof it taught me how to make and choose semantic elements for a webpage and how I can combine different classes for css to make there not have to be as much css code so it is easier to change and fix the website later I also added comments to all the css lines to explain what each of them is doing
